#DESCRIPTION: My domain is Machine Learning, and my first task was implementing a Decision Tree. I wrote and executed the code in Google Colab, ensuring it ran correctly and produced the expected results. To maintain proper documentation and version control, I uploaded the code to GitHub along with a screenshot of the Decision Tree output to visualize the modelâ€™s decision-making process. This task helped me understand how Decision Trees split data based on feature importance and make predictions. Running the implementation in Google Colab allowed me to leverage cloud computing resources efficiently, and by storing everything on GitHub, I ensured easy access, collaboration, and tracking of modifications for future reference and debugging.
